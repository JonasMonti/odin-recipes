            <ol>
                <li>Place a large skillet over medium to high heat. Add a tablespoon of olive oil and fry the sausages, turning them regularly, until evenly cooked. Cut them in half, then slice open lengthwise. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Use the residual oil in the skillet to cook the steak for about 2 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Place a small non-stick pan over medium to high heat. Add one tablespoon of olive oil, then crack the egg in. Let it cook for 3 minutes uncovered for a runny yolk.</li>
                <li>While the egg cooks, lightly toast both slices of bread, then assemble the sandwich in the following order: bread, sliced ham, steak, sausages, bread.</li>
                <li>Bring the Francesinha sauce back to a boil.</li>
                <li>Place the fried egg on top of your sandwich, arrange the slices of cheese around it.</li>
                <li>Pour enough hot Francesinha sauce on top for it to melt the cheese and pool on the plate. Serve with French fries. Enjoy!</li>
